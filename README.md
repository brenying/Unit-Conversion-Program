# Unit Conversion Program

## Objective
This project implements a comprehensive Java-based unit conversion tool that allows users to interactively convert between ounces, grams, pounds, kilograms, inches, centimeters, miles, and kilometers. It demonstrates structured menu navigation, numeric validation, formatted output, looping control structures, and practical unit conversion calculations.

### Skills Learned
- Building interactive console applications with Java.
- Parsing and validating numeric user input using the Scanner class.
- Implementing unit conversion logic across multiple measurement systems.
- Using loops, switch statements, and boolean flags for menu-driven program flow.
- Applying formatted console output using printf.
- Designing reusable helper methods for UI tasks like clearing the screen and printing titles.

### Tools Used
- Java (JDK)
- Scanner for reading and validating user input
- Console-based interface for displaying menus and conversion results
- printf formatting for clean tabular output
